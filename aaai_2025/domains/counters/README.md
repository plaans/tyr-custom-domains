# Counters

## Source

`counters-numeric` domain of IPC 2023.

## Modifications

- Add a control parameter to choose by how much the increase/decrease is done (*Done with UPF*).

## Domain Description

This domain models a set of counters whose values can be controlled by two actions, respectively for increase and decrease.
A Planning problem for this domain is one where we look for particular configurations of such counters.  

Based on the Counter paper domain originally created by Guillem Franc`es (<guillem.frances@upf.edu>) and Hector Geffner (<hector.geffner@upf.edu>) and adapted to numeric planning by Enrico Scala (<enricos83@gmail.com>) and Miquel Ramirez (<miquel.ramirez@gmail.com>).
