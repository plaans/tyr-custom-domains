# Match Cellar (Temporal, Numeric, ICE)

## Domain Description

This domain is based on the [Match Cellar (Temporal, Numeric)](../match-cellar-temporal-numeric/).
The difference is that the LIGHT_MATCH action is shorter and have intermediate effects to turn on the light.
This behavior cannot be represented in PDDL and is fully modeled using [UPF](https://github.com/aiplan4eu/unified-planning).
